## Hard

### 17.1 Add Without Plus
Write a function that adds two numbers. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators

### 17.2 Shuffle
Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffle -- in other words, each of the 52! permutation of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that you are given a random number generator which is perfect.

### 17.3 Random Set
Write a method to randomly generate a set of m integers from an array of size n. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen.

### 17.4 Missing Number
An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch jth bit of A[i]", which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?

### 17.5 Letters and Numbers
Given an array filled with letters and numbers, find the longest subarray with an equal number of letters and numbers.

### 17.6 Count of 2s
Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).
```
Input: 25
Output: 9 (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25)
```

### 17.7 Baby Names
Each year, the government releases a list of 10000 most common baby names and their frequencies (the number of babies with that name). The only problem with this is that some names have multiple spellings. For example, "John" and "Jon" are essentially the same name but would be listed seperately in the list. Given two lists, one of the names/frequencies and other of pairs of equivalent names, write an algorithm to print new list of the true frequency of each name. Note that if John and Jon are synonyms, and Jon and Johnny are synonyms, then John and Johnny are synonyms. (It is both transitive and symmetric). In the final list, any name can be used as the real name.
```
Input: Names: John (15), Jon (12), Chris (13), Kris(4), Christopher (19)
       Synonyms: (Jon, John), (John, Johnny), (Chris, Kris), (Chris, Christopher)
Output: John (27), Chris (36)
```

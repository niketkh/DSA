## Object Oriented Design

### 7.1 Deck of Cards
Design the data structure for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

### 7.2 Call Center
Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design classes abd data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns call to the first available employee.

### 7.3 Jukebox
Design a musical jukebox using object oriented principles

### 7.4 Parking Lot
Design a parking lot using object oriented principles

### 7.5 Online Book Reader
Design the data structures for an online book reader system.

### 7.6 Jigsaw
Implement an NxN jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle. You can assume that you have a fitsWith method which, when passed two puzzle edges, returns true if two edges belong together.

### 7.7 Chat Server
Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problems to solve?

### 7.8 Othello
Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture atleast one of your opponent's pieces. The game ends when either use has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to person with most pieces. Implement the object oriented design for Othello.

### 7.9 Circular Array
Implement a Circular Array class that supports an array like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard for (Obj o: circularArray) notation.

### 7.10 Minesweeper
Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is the classic single player computer game where NxN grid has B mines (or bombs) hidden across the grid. The remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them. The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surrounding eight cells. The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a bomb, the player loses. If it is a number, the number is exposed. If it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (upto and including surrounding numeric cells) are exposed. The player wins when all non bomb cells are exposed. The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than block user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb.

### 7.11 File System
Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in memory file system. Illustrate with an example in code where possible.

### 7.12 Hash Table
Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.

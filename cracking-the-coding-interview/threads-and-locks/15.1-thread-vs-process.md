### Process
* A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution
* A process is an independent entity to which system resources (e.g. CPU time and memory) are allocated
* Each process is executed in seperate address space, and one process cannot access the variables and data structures of another process
* If a process wishes to access another process' resources, interprocess communications have to be used. This inlcudes pipes, files, sockers and other forms

### Thread
* A thread exists within a process and shares the process' resources (including its heap space)
* Multiple threads within the same process will share the same heap space
* This is very different from processes, which cannot directly access the memory of another process
* A thread is a particular execution path of a process
* Thread is also known as light weight process
* When one thread modifies a process resource, the change is immediately visible to sibling threads
* Threads are not independent of one other like processes as a result threads shares with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals. But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.
* Examples: 
    - In a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. 
    - MS word uses multipe threads, one thread to format text, other thread to process inputs, etc
*   Advantages of Threads over Process
    - If a process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completed its execution, then its output can be immediately responded
    - Context switch time between threads is less compared to process context switch
    - If we have multiple threads in a process, then we can schedule multiple threads on multiple processor. This will make process execution faster
    - Resources like code, data and file can be shared among all threads within a process. Stack and registers can't be shared among threads. Each thread have its own stack and registers
    - Communication between multiple threads is easier as thread shares common address space
    - If a process is divided into multiple threads and each thread function is considered as one job, then number of jobs completed per unit time is increased. Thus, increasing the throughput of the system
* Types of threads
    - User Level Thread
    - Kernel Level Thread

Difference|Process|Thread
---|---|---
Definition | An executing instance of a program | Particular execution path of a process
Process | It has its own copy of data segment of the parent process | It has direct access to the data segment of its process
Communication | Processes must use inter-process communication to communicate with sibling processes | Threads can directly communicate with other threads of its process
Overhead | Process have considerable overhead | Threads have almost no overhead
Creation | New process require duplication of parent process | New threads are easily created
Control | Processes can exercise control over child processes | Threads can exercise considerable control over threads of the same process 
Changes | Any change in the parent process does not affect child processes | Any change in the main thread may affect the behavior of other threads of the process
Memory | Run in seperate memory spaces | Run in shared memory spaces
File descriptors | Most file descriptors are not shared | File descriptors are shared
File System | There is no sharing of file system context | File system context is shared
Signal | It does not share signal handling | Signal handling is shared
Controlled by | Process is controlled by the operating system | Threads are controlled by programmer in program
Dependence | Processes are independent | Threads are dependent

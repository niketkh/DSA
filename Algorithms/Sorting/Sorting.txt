-> Sorting
	-> Sorting is an algorithm that arranges elements of a list in certain order ascending or descending
	-> Output is permutation or reordering of input
	-> Sorting is one of the important categories of algorithms in computer science. Sometimes sorting reduces the problem complexity 
	-> Sorting is used to reduce search complexity
	-> Sorting algorithms can be classified based on number of factors like number of comparisons, number of swaps, memory usage, recursion, stability (relative order), adaptability (presortedness), internal sort vs external sort (internal memory vs external memory)

-> Different Sorting Algorithms
	-> Bubble Sort
		-> Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
		-> Time Complexity
			-> Best Case: O(n) 
			-> Average Case: O(n^2)
			-> Worst Case: O(n^2)
		-> Space Complexity
			-> Worst Case: O(1)

	-> Selection Sort
	-> Insertion Sort
	-> Shell Sort
	-> Merge Sort
	-> Quick Sort
	-> Heap Sort
	-> Tree Sort
	-> Counting Sort
	-> Bucket Sort
	-> Radix Sort
	-> Topological Sort
	-> External Merge Sort

# Sorting

* Sorting is an algorithm that arranges elements of a list in certain order ascending or descending
* Output is permutation or reordering of input
* Sorting is one of the important categories of algorithms in computer science
* Sorting reduces the problem complexity for many problems 
* Sorting is used to reduce search complexity
* Sorting algorithms can be classified based on number of factors like 
	- Number of comparisons
	- Number of swaps
	- Memory usage
	- Recursion
	- Stability (relative order)
	- Adaptability (presortedness)
	- Internal sort vs External sort (internal memory vs external memory)

## Different Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
* Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
* Time Complexity
	- Best Case: **O(n)** 
	- Average Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
	- Worst Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
* Space Complexity
    - Worst Case: **O(1)**

### Selection Sort
* The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
* Selection Sort never makes more than **O(n)** swaps and can be useful when memory write is an expensive operation
* Time Complexity
	- Best Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
	- Average Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
	- Worst Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
* Space Complexity
	- Worst Case: **O(1)**
    
### Insertion Sort
* Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands
* Insertion sort can sort the list as it receives it. 
* Efficient for small data
* Online, Stable, In place
* Time Complexity
    - Best Case: **O(n)**
    - Average Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
    - Worst Case: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
* Space Complexity
    - Worst Case: **O(1)**

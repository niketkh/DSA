## Linked List

#### Advantages
```
-> Can be expanded in O(1) i.e constant time 
-> Does not require one block allocation. One can start with space for just one element
```

#### Disadvantages
```
-> Takes O(n) time to access element in worst case
-> Cannot take advantage of modern CPU caching methods as there is no special locality in memory
-> Hard to manipulate
-> Extra memory space required for pointers
```


## Arrays

#### Advantages
```
-> Constant access time i.e O(1)
-> Simple and easy to use
```

#### Disadvantages
```
-> Fixed size
-> One block allocation
-> Complex position based insertion
```

## 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.

## Java Solution

### Method 1
```
// You need to treat n as an unsigned value
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    n = n & (-1 >>> 32);
    int count = 0;
    while(n != 0) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Method 2
```
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int bits = 0;
    int mask = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        if ((n & mask) != 0) {
            bits++;
        }
        mask <<= 1;
    }
    return bits;
}
```

### Method 3 - Fastest
In the binary representation, the least significant 11-bit in nn always corresponds to a 00-bit in n - 1n−1. Therefore, anding the two numbers nn and n - 1n−1 always flips the least significant 11-bit in nn to 00, and keeps all other bits the same.

```
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        sum++;
        n &= (n - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}
```
